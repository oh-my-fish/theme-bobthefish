### Installation

Be sure to have Oh My Fish installed. Then just:

    omf install bobthefish

You will need a [Powerline-patched font][btf-patching] for this to work, unless you enable the compatibility fallback option:

    set -g theme_powerline_fonts no

[I recommend picking one of these][btf-fonts]. For more advanced awesome, install a [nerd fonts patched font][btf-nerd-fonts], and enable nerd fonts support:

    set -g theme_nerd_fonts yes

This theme is based loosely on [agnoster][btf-agnoster].


### Features

 * A helpful, but not too distracting, greeting.
 * A subtle timestamp hanging out off to the right.
 * Powerline-style visual hotness.
 * More colors than you know what to do with.
 * An abbreviated path which doesn't abbreviate the name of the current project.
 * All the things you need to know about Git in a glance.
 * Visual indication that you can't write to the current directory.


### The Prompt

 * Status flags:
     * Previous command failed (**`!`**)
     * Private mode (**ðŸ”’** or **`â¦¸`**)
     * You currently have superpowers (**`$`**)
     * Background jobs (**`%`**)
 * Current vi mode
 * `User@Host` (unless you're the default user)
 * Current RVM, rbenv or chruby (Ruby) version
 * Current virtualenv (Python) version
     * _If you use virtualenv, you will probably need to disable the default virtualenv prompt, since it doesn't play nice with fish: `set -x VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT 1`_
 * Current NVM/FNM version (Nodejs) (inactive by default; see configurations in the next paragraph)
 * Abbreviated parent directory
 * Current directory, or Git or Mercurial project name
 * Current project's repo branch (<img width="16" alt="branch-glyph" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/53660/8768360/53ee9b58-2e32-11e5-9977-cee0063936fa.png"> master) or detached head (`âž¦` d0dfd9b)
 * Git or Mercurial status, via colors and flags:
     * Dirty working directory (**`*`**)
     * Untracked files (**`â€¦`**)
     * Staged changes (**`~`**)
     * Stashed changes (**`$`**)
     * Unpulled commits (**`-`**)
     * Unpushed commits (**`+`**)
     * Unpulled _and_ unpushed commits (**`Â±`**)
     * _Note that not all of these have been implemented for hg yet :)_

set -g theme_newline_prompt '$ '
```
**Git options**

- `theme_display_git_default_branch`. By default theme will hide/collapse the branch name in your prompt when you are using a Git _default branch_ i.e. historically `master` and often `main` now. Set to `yes` to stop these branches from being hidden/collapsed.
- `theme_git_default_branches`. The big cloud repos (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab et al.) are moving away from using `master` as the default branch name, and allow you to choose your own. As of version **2.28**, Git also supports custom default branch names via the `init.defaultBranch` config option. If our defaults of `master main` don't suit you, you can add/remove names in thist list i.e. `main trunk`. This ensures correct hiding/collapsing behaviour with custom default branch names (unless option above is activated).

**Title options**

- `theme_title_display_process`. By default theme doesn't show current process name in terminal title. If you want to show it, just set to `yes`.
- `theme_title_display_path`. Use `no` to hide current working directory from title.
- `theme_title_display_user`. Set to `yes` to show the current user in the tab title (unless you're the default user).
- `theme_title_use_abbreviated_path`. Default is `yes`. This means your home directory will be displayed as `~` and `/usr/local` as `/u/local`. Set it to `no` if you prefer full paths in title.

**Prompt options**

- `theme_display_ruby`. Use `no` to completely hide all information about Ruby version. By default Ruby version displayed if there is the difference from default settings.
- `theme_display_node`. If set to `yes`, will display current NVM or FNM node version.
- `theme_display_vagrant`. This feature is disabled by default, use `yes` to display Vagrant status in your prompt. Please note that only the VirtualBox and VMWare providers are supported.
- `theme_display_vi`. By default the vi mode indicator will be shown if vi or hybrid key bindings are enabled. Use `no` to hide the indicator, or `yes` to show the indicator.
- `theme_display_k8s_context`. This feature is disabled by default. Use `yes` to show the current kubernetes context (`> kubectl config current-context`).
- `theme_display_k8s_namespace`. This feature is disabled by default. Use `yes` to show the current kubernetes namespace.
- `theme_display_aws_vault_profile`. This feature is disabled by default. Use `yes` to show the currently executing [AWS Vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) profile.
- `theme_display_user`. If set to `yes`, display username always, if set to `ssh`, only when an SSH-Session is detected, if set to no, never.
- `theme_display_hostname`. Same behaviour as `theme_display_user`.
- `theme_display_sudo_user`. If set to `yes`, displays the sudo-username in a root shell. For example, when calling `sudo -s` and having this option set to `yes`, the username of the user, who called `sudo -s`, will be displayed.
- `theme_show_exit_status`. Set this option to `yes` to have the prompt show the last exit code if it was non_zero instead of just the exclamation mark.
- `theme_display_jobs_verbose`. If set to `yes` this option displays the number of currently running background jobs next to the percent sign.
- `theme_git_worktree_support`. If you do any git worktree shenanigans, setting this to `yes` will fix incorrect project-relative path display. If you don't do any git worktree shenanigans, leave it disabled. It's faster this way :)
- `theme_use_abbreviated_branch_name`. Set to `yes` to truncate git branch names in the prompt.
- `fish_prompt_pwd_dir_length`. bobthefish respects the Fish `$fish_prompt_pwd_dir_length` setting to abbreviate the prompt path. Set to `0` to show the full path, `1` (default) to show only the first character of each parent directory name, or any other number to show up to that many characters.
- `theme_project_dir_length`. The same as `$fish_prompt_pwd_dir_length`, but for the path relative to the current project root. Defaults to `0`; set to any other number to show an abbreviated path.
- `theme_newline_cursor`. Use `yes` to have cursor start on a new line. By default the prompt is only one line. When working with long directories it may be preferrend to have cursor on the next line. Setting this to `clean` instead of `yes` suppresses the caret on the new line.
- `theme_newline_prompt`. Use a custom prompt with newline cursor. By default this is the chevron right glyph or `>` when powerline fonts are disabled.

**Color scheme options**

| ![dark][btf-dark]           | ![light][btf-light]                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ![solarized][btf-solarized] | ![solarized-light][btf-solarized-light] |
| ![base16][btf-base16]       | ![base16-light][btf-base16-light]       |
| ![zenburn][btf-zenburn]     | ![terminal-dark][btf-terminal-dark]     |
| ![nord][btf-nord]           |                                         |

You can use the function `bobthefish_display_colors` to preview the prompts in
any color scheme.

Set `theme_color_scheme` in a terminal session or in your fish startup files to
one of the following options to change the prompt colors.

- `dark`. The default bobthefish theme.
- `light`. A lighter version of the default theme.
- `solarized` (or `solarized-dark`), `solarized-light`. Dark and light variants
  of Solarized.
- `base16` (or `base16-dark`), `base16-light`. Dark and light variants of the
  default Base16 theme.
- `zenburn`. An adaptation of Zenburn.
- `gruvbox`. An adaptation of gruvbox.
- `dracula`. An adaptation of dracula.
- `nord`. An adaptation of nord.

Some of these may not look right if your terminal does not support 24 bit color,
in which case you can try one of the `terminal` schemes (below). However, if
you're using Solarized, Base16 (default), or Zenburn in your terminal and the
terminal *does* support 24 bit color, the built in schemes will look nicer.

There are several scheme that use whichever colors you currently have loaded
into your terminal. The advantage of using the schemes that fall through to the
terminal colors is that they automatically adapt to something acceptable
whenever you change the 16 colors in your terminal profile.
- `terminal` (or `terminal-dark` or `terminal-dark-black`)
- `terminal-dark-white`. Same as `terminal`, but use white as the foreground
  color on top of colored segments (in case your colors are very dark).
- `terminal-light` (or `terminal-light-white`)
- `terminal-light-black`. Same as `terminal-light`, but use black as the
  foreground color on top of colored segments (in case your colors are very
  bright).

For some terminal themes, like dark base16 themes, the path segments in the
prompt will be indistinguishable from the background. In those cases, try one of
the following variations; they are identical to the `terminal` schemes except
for using bright black (`brgrey`) and dull white (`grey`) in the place of black
and bright white.
- `terminal2` (or `terminal2-dark` or `terminal2-dark-black`)
- `terminal2-dark-white`
- `terminal2-light` (or `terminal2-light-white`)
- `terminal2-light-black`

Finally, you can specify your very own color scheme by setting
`theme_color_scheme` to `user`. In that case, you also need to define some
variables to set the colors of the prompt. See the "Colors" section of
`fish_prompt.fish` for details.


**VCS options**
- `set -g theme_vcs_ignore_paths /some/path /some/other/path{foo,bar}`. Ignore project paths for Git or Mercurial. Supports glob patterns.

### Overrides

You can disable the theme default greeting, vi mode prompt, right prompt, or title entirelyÂ â€” or override with your own â€” by adding custom functions to `~/.config/fish/functions`:

- `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_greeting.fish`
- `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_mode_prompt.fish`
- `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_right_prompt.fish`
- `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_title.fish`

To disable them completely, use an empty function:

```fish
function fish_right_prompt; end
```

â€¦Â Or copy one from your favorite theme, make up something of your own, or copy/paste a bobthefish default function and modify it to your taste!

```fish
function fish_greeting
  set_color $fish_color_autosuggestion
  echo "I'm completely operational, and all my circuits are functioning perfectly."
  set_color normal
end
```
